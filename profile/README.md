# Hi, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹
I'm a data engineer passionate about making data infrastructure more accessible. I believe the best data tools should be available to everyone, regardless of their team size or technical background.

## Current Projects
### [dagster-odp](https://github.com/runodp/dagster-odp)
A configuration-driven framework built on top of [Dagster](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster) that lets data teams build robust pipelines using YAML/JSON instead of writing extensive code
