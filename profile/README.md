# ODP (Open Data Platform)
We're building an integrated, open-source data platform that makes modern data infrastructure accessible to teams of all sizes and technical backgrounds.

## Our Vision
1. **Pre-integrated Modern Data Stack**: A curated set of open-source tools that work seamlessly together
2. **Configuration over Code**: Deploy data pipelines through configuration rather than complex Python code
3. **Simplified Experience**: Remove the complexity of choosing, integrating, and maintaining data tools

## Current Projects
### [dagster-odp](https://github.com/runodp/dagster-odp)
A configuration-driven framework for Dagster that enables teams to build robust data pipelines without extensive coding
